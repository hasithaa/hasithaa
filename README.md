## 👋 Hello there, I'm 𝐇𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐚 𝐀𝐫𝐚𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐚!

### About Me

👨‍💻 I'm currently working on **Ballerina Lang**, a programming language for integration, as the lead developer of the Ballerina Compiler Team. I'm also one of the primary contributors to the Ballerina Language Design.

🚀 Before joining the Ballerina team, I specialized in building Java middleware for enterprise integration using technologies such as WS-BPEL, BPMN, WS-HumanTask, ESB, and Web Services. My experience includes developing strong enterprise integration development skills with Java, BPEL, BPMN, and Synapse languages.

🏢 At present, I hold the position of Associate Director/Architect at WSO2 LLC.

🎮 When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing 𝐃𝐨𝐭𝐚𝟐 for fun.

🌐 You can find my tech blog on Ballerina at [https://bal.tips](https://bal.tips) and here, I'll be sharing my thoughts on Ballerina Language and Coding Tips etc. My portfolio is available at [https://hasithaa.github.io](https://hasithaa.github.io). Stay tuned for more!

🧑‍🎓 Experienced engineer with a BSc in Computer Science and Engineering (Hons) from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

### 🚀 Projects

#### [Ballerina.io](https://ballerina.io)

<img src="github.svg" height="15px" width="15px" alt="GitHub" /> [ballerina-lang](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang) 

I'm currently leading the design and architecture of the Ballerina Language Compiler implementation. Before Ballerina became a fully-fledged general-purpose language, we experimented with DSL-like syntaxes, and I was a part of the compiler and runtime team from that time. After several years of dedicated development and design, we have successfully built a Ballerina Compiler that meets the needs of developers who want to write integrations. I'm proud to have played a key role in this achievement and continue to work towards improving the language and its tools for the benefit of the development community.

#### Ballerina Language Specification

🌐 [Current Spec](https://ballerina.io/spec/lang/master), 🌐 [2022R4](https://ballerina.io/spec/lang/2022R4/)

As a primary contributor to the Ballerina Language Specification from the beginning of the language design process, I have been involved in several iterations, feature changes, re-implementations, and design verifications. Being an initial member of the Ballerina team, I have played an active role in shaping various language features and helping the team throughout the development process. I'm proud to say that our efforts have resulted in a well-designed language that meets the needs of modern integration challenges.

#### WSO2 Business Process Server

<img src="github.svg" height="15px" width="15px" alt="GitHub" /> [Product BPS (Archived)](https://github.com/wso2-attic/product-bps)<br/>

WSO2 Business Process Server (BPS) was an easy-to-use, open-source business process server that executed business processes written using BPMN, WS-BPEL, and WS-HumanTasks standards. As a developer and release manager of this product, I had the opportunity to contribute to its development and add various features, including HumanTask Coordination, Caching layer, and multiple UX improvements. While the product is now deprecated, I'm always happy to answer any questions you may have about it. Feel free to contact me anytime.

#### ODE

🌐 [Apache ODE (Retired)](https://ode.apache.org/)

This repository contains the WSO2 maintained fork of the retired Apache ODE project, which was a WS-BPEL compliant web services orchestration engine. As a developer on this project, I had the opportunity to work on its development and maintenance. While BPEL has less traction now and the parent project is retired, I'm always happy to answer any questions you may have about it.

#### WSO2 Business Rules Server

<img src="github.svg" height="15px" width="15px" alt="GitHub" /> [Product BRS (Archived)](https://github.com/wso2-attic/product-brs)

WSO2 BRS was a lightweight and easy-to-use Open Source Business Rules Server that allowed business decisions to be exposed as secure and reliable web services and integrated with an organization's application integration infrastructure. As a maintainer and release manager of this repository, I had the opportunity to contribute to its development and maintenance. However, the product is now deprecated.

#### Java4BPEL Extension

<img src="github.svg" height="15px" width="15px" alt="GitHub" /> [java4bpel](https://github.com/hasithaa/java4bpel)<br/>

Java4BPEL is an extension for Apache ODE and WSO2 BPS that I developed. It introduces a new BEPL extension activity that allows Java libraries to be invoked using BEPL. This extension activity enables the integration of Java code within the BPEL process flow, providing greater flexibility and customizability. I'm proud to have developed this extension and hope that it has proven useful for those using Apache ODE and WSO2 BPS.

#### MetCat

🌐 [metcat](https://code.google.com/archive/a/apache-extras.org/p/metcat)<br/>

The MetCat project was aimed at developing a metadata catalog that could be integrated with the Apache Airavata project. The project's primary focus was on capturing metadata from workflows and assisting in scalable metadata management and user-defined queries. While the project is now deprecated, it was a valuable learning experience and an opportunity to contribute to the development of an important tool in the scientific community.
